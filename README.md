# Eclair

Eclair is a bot I made for my own use and management of roles on my discord "guild"(server).
Writen in [python](https://www.python.org/) with the [discord.py](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/) library.

The bot requires the following permissions to work:
- Manage Roles
- Manage Channels
- Read Text Channels & See Voice Channels
- Manage Messages
- Read Message History

As of right now to run simply install the requirements
```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And the to run the app simply run the py file
```bash
python main.py
```
